# kamekku14’s Obvious Layouts
Hi, I’m [**kamekku14**](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=28710) and this is my repository of all the layouts I’ve created for the website, [SMW Central](https://www.smwcentral.net/). I’ve decided to host these on GitHub because:
 * I have to save some space in my File Bin to make room for my *SMW* hacking-related stuff.
 * I had some serious issues with other file-hosting sites (curse you, Dropbox!).
 * I may have gotten the chance get some layout requests up and running.

Want to have a post layout of your own? [Send me via PM](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=pm&do=compose&user=28710) or make a request in [this thread](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=63144)!
